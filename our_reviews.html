	Valeria is absolutely brilliant with our beloved cat Fiadh!!<br />
	When we go away we always come back to a very happy kittie who has clearly been paid a lot of attention during Valeria’s visit.<br />
	Valeria is always communicative, sending photos and videos which is reassuring when we are away.<br />
	Highly recommended!!

	A very thorough and caring service by someone who clearly has a genuine love and appreciation for our dear feline friends!<br />
	I can't recommend them enough. As their motto goes, they did look after our 2 cats like their own.<br />
	They also sent us daily pictures on whatsup which made a great deal of difference to us.<br />
	Thank you again for everything!

	We could not recommend Valeria highly enough!<br />
	The communication was excellent, thank you so much for sending us pictures, that really gave us peace of mind and reassurance.<br />
	Valeria not only fed the cats, gave the medicine and cleaned the litter, she also gave the cuddles and playtime our indoor cats are used to.<br />
	The cats had clearly been stimulated everyday; for the first time Tilda didn't go on hunger strike as she always did when we go on holidays.<br />
	Thanks again!!

	I felt very relaxed leaving my cat in Valeria’s care.<br />
	Everything was perfect and we would definitely ask Valeria for her help again.<br />
	Communication with us was great and it’s clear she has a very caring manner.

	Valeria is absolutely wonderful. It’s obvious she really cares and loves cats.<br />
	I felt so comfortable leaving my baby in her care and loved receiving updates of him whilst I was away.<br />
	I feel grateful that I have found someone who I know I can rely on, does a great job, and who is super professional.<br />
	I would highly recommend her services!

	Valeria is an absolute star.<br />
	My cats are very anxious and she handled their needs with total care and dedication.<br />
	Her updates were informative and reassuring, too.<br />
	I will be using her services again.<br />

	I could not be happier with Valeria and the service she has provided.<br />
	From the get go she was organised, kind and dedicated and I felt very comfortable leaving our kitty in her hands.
	Whilst I was away I felt very reassured by the daily updates and photos she sent.<br />
	I have already recommended her to family members and will definitely be using her services again.<br />
	Thanks again!<br />

	Valeria became part of our family when she first stepped into our home.<br />
	Boney, our cat, fell in love with her at first sight and we adore her too. She's genuinely kind and caring and kept us updated with messages and photos.<br />
	Wed highly recommend Valeria as she's so trustworthy, reliable and she understands cats so well.<br />
	Thank you again Valeria! X<br />

	Valeria has shown great care and love when looking after our cats.<br />
	She goes 'the extra mile' to make sure they are healthy and happy.<br />
	Valeria sent daily communications including photos and videos: I felt reassured on holiday, knowing the cats were being looked after so well.<br />
	On our return, the litter trays and feeding areas were immaculate.<br />
	I cannot recommend Valeria highly enough.<br />

	Valeria looked after my elderly cat so well and administered her medications along with her good and water.<br />
	I would highly recommend her heartfelt care and concern for Kitty.<br />

	Royal Cat Sitting provide a really excellent service. We’ve had many people cat sit for our lovely cat Millie and Valeria has been the best.
	She’s a very attentive cat sitter who shares lots of updates. We’ve used Royal Cat Sitting many times before and will do again!<br />

	We absolutely recommend Valeria at Royal Cat Sitting to look after your pets with care, professionalism and attention. She looked after our two cats (including our 18 year old cat with medical issues) and totally won them over. We’ll be using Valeria every time we’re away.<br />

	Valeria has looked after our cat several times now, and I would 100% recommend Royal Cat Sitting to anyone needing an attentive and caring cat sitter. The daily updates and photos are a great day touch, and we happily trust our cat to her care and will continue to use her cat sitting service in the future.<br />

	Our cat loves Valeria! We get really nice updates and photos on how he is and she lets us know if she thinks anything is amiss. She clears and checks his litter tray as well as feeding, cuddles, and playing!<br />

	We were so lucky to find Valeria - if you need a reliable, dependable and trustworthy cat sitter look no further. She's taken such great care of our new rescue cat, feeding her and keeping her company to make sure she remains comfortable while we're away. Great communication and keeps us updated with photos to stop us worrying over nothing!<br />
	Couldn't recommend the service highly enough, she's even even helping us out over Christmas.<br />
